> With Ceph, we have <b>unlimited flexibility in our topology</b>. Switching from
> proprietary systems to open source has been so much more collaborative,
> enabling us to get much more than we hoped from the initial project. It
> has been a win-win. We really like GPL/LGPL licensing, and we believe that
> ‘free’ open source means better collaboration.
